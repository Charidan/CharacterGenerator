CharacterGenerator
==================
This project was an experiment testing the complexity of making a framework for comprehensive indexing and comparison of the expanded 3.5 D&D classes including all sourcebooks. The framework would end up being relatively simple, but the entry of text data would need to be done manually and at high volume. It was judged that completing this project would be a lot more work to complete than it would actually save.
